## weather dashboard
## Description 
The aim concerning this project was to use HTML/CSS/Javascript to forge a active weather app. This app influence openweathermap API. Using fetch requests, I am able to approach the data determined by openweather map. I therefore use JS to dynamically create elements that are live with the data supported by the fetch request.

During this project I studied and used a lot of Javascript. This contained setting global and local variables, arrays, functions, if and if/else statements. 

## Usage
To access, simply enter the city name in the search bar, itll populate the closest search and then you click on the city to populate the data.
